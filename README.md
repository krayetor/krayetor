<!-- Quick intro -->
<section>
  <h2>🌱 About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I’m a curious learner on a growth journey — training with <strong>ALX Frontend Web Development</strong> and exploring
    <strong>content creation</strong> and <strong>AI career essentials</strong>. I believe being a beginner is a strength:
    I share what I learn, iterate fast, and build small projects to level up continuously.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>What inspires me:</strong> empowering young people — especially Africans — with practical, creative, and
    accessible tech skills. I love turning ideas into clean interfaces and short, helpful content that others can learn from.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>My vision:</strong> become a versatile frontend developer & UX creator who builds polished, user-friendly web
    experiences and learning tools that welcome beginners and help them grow.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>I enjoy working on:</strong> portfolio websites, responsive UI components, learning resources (mini-tutorials),
    design systems for small teams, and beginner-friendly cybersecurity/awareness tools.
